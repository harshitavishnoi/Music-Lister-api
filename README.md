# Music-Lister-api

I have developed a HTTP JSON Go API for MusicLister application which is capable of to create users and update a playlist of their choices with songs having title, composer and music link.
This API have the following routes : 
● /login : This route allows the user to login with unique secret code and if user is found, it will return details of the user

● /getAllSongsOfPlaylist : This returns all the songs in a particular playlist including all attributes of
a song.
● /createPlaylist : This allows to create a new playlist with its attributes.
● /addSongToPlaylist : This allows to update the playlist by adding a new song to the playlist
with all the attributes of the song.
● /deleteSongFromPlaylist : This allows to delete a song from the playlist
● /deletePlaylist : This allows to delete a playlist
● /getSongDetail : This allows to get all attributes of a song
